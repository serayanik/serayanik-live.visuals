Trippy Surfer is an interactive Processing sketch that synchronizes psychedelic visuals with a specific segment (00:18 to 01:20) of Gorillaz's "Feel Good Inc." The experience features six switchable backgrounds including rainbow tunnels, starfields, and warping 3D effects, overlaid with time-synchronized imagery that appears at precise moments throughout the track. A surfer character floats across the screen while speech bubbles, celestial objects, and attention-grabbing graphics cycle through various positions with pulsing and fading effects.
